## Usage of assert statement
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement

## Calling pytest through ```python -m pytest [...]```
This is almost equivalent to invoking the command line script ```pytest [...]``` directly, except that calling via python will also add the current directory to ```sys.path```.
